Developped on conda with python3.7, you can use assignment3.yml file to reconstruct the environment.
Basically libraries used are :
pillow, pandas, numpy, matplotlib.

How to run the program:
You can run assignment3.py  with 2 arguments : 
the first one is the path to orl-database folder,
the second one is an interger for number of eigen faces to report identification rate for.

example:

$ python assignment3.py './orl-database' 20

and the result is: 2 images are plotted and one line is printed to the terminal:
For 20 eigen faces identification rate is 0.855
