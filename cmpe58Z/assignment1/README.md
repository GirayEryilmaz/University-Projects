How to make a demo:


In the conda environmet run:
python <path to analyze_similarity_matrix.py> <path to similarity matrix> <path to class labels>

for example
(biometrics) giray@pc:~/cmpe58Z_assign1$ python analyze_similarity_matrix.py data1/data1_SM.txt data1/data1_Class_Labels.txt


Notes: 2 plots will be displayed, for python to proceed, you will need to close the image. Second will not show up until you close the first one.
